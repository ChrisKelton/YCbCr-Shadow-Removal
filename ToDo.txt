Possible Things To Do:

o Two Pass KMeans
	- send image through again but this time only looking at the pixels that were masked in the first pass through.

o Test on images with source of shadow in image, with knowing where objects are, so filter out any mask over objects.
	- Mask will grab objects that are very dark.

o Test on large GeoSpatial images.

o Figure out what's wrong with multiprocessing implementation.
